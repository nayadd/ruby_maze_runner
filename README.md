# ruby_maze_runner
Testing implementation of a game using Gosu Library and Mazes. 

Tested on Ruby 2.2.2p95 - Mac Os X Yosemite

Requirements:
+ Ruby 2 (It's a given, but who knows who is reading this...)
+ Gosu (check https://libgosu.org/ , for platform specific instructions, probably will be something like `gem install gosu` )
+ RMagick (`gem install rmagick`)

To run it `ruby map_test.rb`

You will be greeted by this wonderful image:

Walking the maze is obvious (USE THE KEYBOARD ARROWS!!) 
You are represented by the full glory of the red asterisk ("*"), your goal is the G in the maze!
Reach it and you'll informed in the terminal (yeah I know crappy reward...)

Needless to say it's a work in progress

TODO:
+ Menu
+ Better Graphics
+ Victory Message
+ Time / Movements Counter
+ Auto-Solve / Path Coloring
+ Other Maze Generators / Formats
